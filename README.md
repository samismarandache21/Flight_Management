🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
☕ Java	Core programming language
🗄️ SQL Databases	Persistent data storage and retrieval
🏗️ OOP Principles	Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
🧪 JUnit	Unit testing framework
🎯 Project Features
🔹 1. Object-Oriented Architecture (OOP)
Encapsulation: Data members are private, accessed through getters/setters​
Inheritance: Structured hierarchy among classes to promote code reuse​
Polymorphism: Function overloading and overriding for flexible operations​
🔹 2. Database Integration
Persistent Data: Utilizes SQL databases to store information about flights, passengers, and bookings​
Data Integrity: Ensures consistency and reliability of data through ACID properties​
🔹 3. User-Friendly Interface
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Provides a straightforward and intuitive way for users to interact with the system​
Menu-Driven Navigation: Users can navigate through various options seamlessly​
🔹 4. Comprehensive Error Handling
Robust Error Detection: Identifies and manages errors gracefully to prevent application crashes​
User Feedback: Provides clear messages to users in case of invalid operations or inputs​
